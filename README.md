Calling Assistant for Elders

It may be a little bit strange to give my Grandma an iPad to keep her in touch with me during my study abroad. But in that case, I want the best experience for my Grandma.

That's pretty why I am writing this. An easier way for elders to call their relatives.

Easiness in:

1.  Recognization  --  Face

2.  Finding        --  Pop right up

3.  Calling        --  Touch
